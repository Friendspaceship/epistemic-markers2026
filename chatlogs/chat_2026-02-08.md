# Chat Log

## 2026-02-08 Session Start
- Reconstructed last status from `chatlogs/chat_2026-02-06.md`: last completed work was updating README.md to clarify omitted correlation matrices/scripts from reproducible-light bundle. Blockers: none noted. Next step: await review/further instructions.
## 2026-02-08 Status Check
- Files changed/created: `manuscript/20260208 Judge-Mediated Mapping of Epistemic Structures in TruthfulQA An Exploratory Study with the CPT Anchor-5 Protocol v15.md` (new), `manuscript/20260208 Judge-Mediated Mapping of Epistemic Structures in TruthfulQA - An Exploratory Study with the CPT Anchor-5 Protocol v15.md.pdf` (new), `manuscript/fig1_awareness_index.png` (modified), `manuscript/20260206 Mapping Epistemic Markers in TruthfulQA's Best Answers An Exploratory Study of the CPT Anchor-5 Protocol v13.md` (deleted), `manuscript/20260206 Mapping Epistemic Markers in TruthfulQA's Best Answers An Exploratory Study of the CPT Anchor-5 Protocol v13.pdf` (deleted), `chatlogs/chat_2026-02-08.md` (new).
- Commands run: `Get-Content` (AGENTS.md, README.md, chatlogs/chat_2026-02-06.md, manuscript v15), `git status -sb`.
- Outputs generated: none.
- Decisions/rationale: logged current repo status after user indicated new manuscript upload.
- Blockers: none.
- Next steps: await user instructions (e.g., compare v15 vs prior, update README/links, or validate figures).

## 2026-02-08 14:30 - Claude Code Session

### User Request
User reported that "codex messed around with the manuscript" and requested verification that all changes have been reversed. Subsequently requested session start protocol execution per CLAUDE.md, followed by detailed README.md vs manuscript v15 alignment check.

### Actions Taken
1. Verified git status: working tree clean, no uncommitted changes
2. Confirmed manuscript at commit `fe1d823` (last intentional commit)
3. Followed CLAUDE.md session start protocol:
   - Read CLAUDE.md
   - Read README.md
   - Checked for unmerged chatlogs (none found)
   - Read today's chatlog (chat_2026-02-08.md)
4. Conducted detailed comparison between README.md and manuscript v15
5. Updated README.md to align with v15 manuscript

### Files Modified
- `README.md` (updated manuscript reference, figures list, repository status, added v15 highlights)

### Key Findings
**Critical discrepancies found between README and manuscript v15:**
- Manuscript reference was outdated (v13 → v15, date 20260206 → 20260208)
- Title changed significantly: "Mapping Epistemic Markers" → "Judge-Mediated Mapping of Epistemic Structures"
- Figures section incomplete (missing descriptions for fig2-fig5)
- Repository status date outdated (Jan 28 → Feb 8, 2026)
- New v15 content not documented: preference ratings, four-run sensitivity analysis, response length discussion, dimension correlation analysis
- Academia.edu publication not mentioned

**README.md updates applied:**
- Updated manuscript filename and title to v15
- Added detailed figure descriptions (fig1: Awareness Index, fig2: Preference Distribution, fig3: Dimension Gap Heatmap, fig4: Behavioral Tags, fig5: Dimension Correlation)
- Updated repository status date to February 8, 2026
- Added "New in v15" section highlighting: preference ratings, four-run analysis, response length paradigm discussion, dimension correlation analysis, refined title
- Added academia.edu publication note

### Decisions/Rationale
- Used unified chatlog (chat_2026-02-08.md) per user preference rather than creating separate chat_claude_2026-02-08.md
- Performed comprehensive check due to user note that "many things have been changed"
- Updated README immediately after identifying discrepancies per user approval

### Next Steps
- Await further instructions or validation of README updates
- Consider if git commit is needed for README changes

### Open Questions
None

## 2026-02-08 15:00 - Claude Code: README Framing Alignment

### User Request
User requested check of README's overall framing alignment with manuscript v15 draft (not just file references).

### Analysis
Identified major framing disconnect: README was purely technical/archival (file manifest) while manuscript v15 emphasizes:
- Exploratory/experimental nature throughout
- Judge-mediated method as core innovation
- Observer-conditioned assessments (text × judge interaction)
- CPT (Conventional Paradigm Test) context
- TruthfulQA as "low-hanging fruit" opportunistic choice
- Benchmark culture critique context (epistemic monoculture concerns)
- Epistemic compression as central finding
- Judge-version sensitivity as feature, not just limitation
- Theoretical stance: epistemic structures as observer-interpreted constructs (Mavaddat 2025)

### Actions Taken
Added comprehensive "About This Study" section to README.md covering:
- Study nature: exploratory, judge-mediated, observer-conditioned
- Core approach: CPT Anchor-5 protocol, seven dimensions, Awareness Index
- Research context: benchmark culture critique literature
- TruthfulQA rationale: high-contrast, opportunistic case study
- Key finding: epistemic compression in reference answers
- Judge-model sensitivity: interpretive dependency
- Scope & limitations: method-calibrating, not comprehensive critique

### Files Modified
- `README.md` (added "About This Study" section between header and "What's Included")

### Decisions/Rationale
- Framing must align with manuscript's emphasis on exploratory nature and observer-conditioned assessments
- README should introduce research question and contribution, not just list files
- Important to include "low-hanging fruit" caveat per manuscript's self-critical framing
- Preserved technical "reproducible-light bundle" aspects while adding conceptual context

### Next Steps
- Await user validation of framing alignment
- Consider if git commit is appropriate for README updates
