# Chat Log\n\n## 2026-01-28 Session Start\n- Created new chat log.\n
## 2026-01-28 Update 1
- Files created: chatlogs/chat_2026-01-28.md (session start).
- Commands run: Get-Content -Path AGENTS.md (not found), g --files -g 'AGENTS.md', Get-Content -Path README.md, Get-ChildItem -Path chatlogs (not found), g --files -g 'chat_*.md', New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path chatlogs -Force, Get-ChildItem -Force, Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path scripts.
- Decisions: Created chatlogs directory + today’s log per instructions; noted AGENTS.md missing.
- Blockers: No AGENTS.md found; unclear which "test script" to run or review.
- Next steps: Confirm which script to review/run (likely scripts/verify_light_bundle.py) and what "check the repo" should cover.
## 2026-01-28 Update 2
- Files created: AGENTS.md (temporary minimal instructions per user request).
- Commands run: none.
- Decisions: Kept instructions minimal and non-invasive; referenced README and REPLICATION_GUIDELINES.
- Blockers: None.
- Next steps: Await further repo check/test script instructions.
