# Chat Log

## 2026-01-31 Session Start
- Reconstructed last status from chatlogs/chat_2026-01-28.md: last completed work was running scripts/verify_light_bundle.py and updating manuscript/20260128 Measuring Textual Markers of Epistemic Stance v4.md; next step was awaiting review/further instructions.

## 2026-01-31 Update 1
- Checked additional/ contents and verified referenced correlation-matrix artifacts/scripts appear missing from this repo bundle (see additional/20260129_dimension_correlation_summary.md).

## 2026-01-31 Update 3
- Files modified: README.md (added additional/ mapping entries + clarified that correlation JSON/CSV matrices and generating script are omitted from the reproducible-light bundle).
- Commands run: none (file edited via apply_patch).
- Decisions: Prefer minimal README clarification to prevent users from searching for non-included artifacts referenced in additional/20260129_dimension_correlation_summary.md.
- Blockers: None.
- Next steps: If desired, either add the missing correlation matrices/script to this repo or adjust additional/20260129_dimension_correlation_summary.md wording to avoid implying they exist here.
