# Preliminary Dimension Correlation Summary (2026-01-29)

This note summarizes Pearson correlation matrices computed from per-item dimension scores across **all four runs** (GPT‑4o‑mini, Haiku 3.5, Haiku 3.5 replication, Haiku 4.5), for **both ref and model** sides (8 matrices total). The matrices were generated by `scripts/20260129_compute_dimension_correlations.py` and are stored as JSON/CSV in this folder.

## Consistent High‑Overlap Pairs (mean |r| across 8 matrices)

Across all runs/sides, the largest mean absolute correlations are:
- **Knowledge–Boundary** (mean |r| ≈ 0.794)
- **Reality–Knowledge** (mean |r| ≈ 0.688)
- **Reality–Boundary** (mean |r| ≈ 0.637)
- **Visibility–Boundary** (mean |r| ≈ 0.617)
- **Knowledge–Visibility** (mean |r| ≈ 0.611)

These recurring overlaps are consistent with conceptual bleed among epistemic‑marker dimensions tied to qualification, scope, and evidential framing.

## Value Ranges for Key Pairs (min–max across 8 matrices)

From the eight matrices:
- **Knowledge–Boundary**: 0.659 → 0.870  
- **Reality–Knowledge**: 0.539 → 0.792  
- **Visibility–Boundary**: 0.519 → 0.717  
- **Knowledge–Visibility**: 0.419 → 0.735  
- **Reality–Goal**: 0.163 → 0.894  
- **Reality–Agency**: 0.182 → 0.676  

## Top Pair per Matrix (for quick inspection)

- GPT‑4o‑mini (ref): **Reality–Goal** (0.894)  
- GPT‑4o‑mini (model): **Reality–Boundary** (0.690)  
- Haiku 3.5 (ref): **Knowledge–Boundary** (0.818)  
- Haiku 3.5 (model): **Knowledge–Boundary** (0.825)  
- Haiku 3.5 replication (ref): **Knowledge–Boundary** (0.836)  
- Haiku 3.5 replication (model): **Reality–Knowledge** (0.792)  
- Haiku 4.5 (ref): **Knowledge–Boundary** (0.779)  
- Haiku 4.5 (model): **Knowledge–Boundary** (0.799)  

## Interpretation (preliminary)

The strongest and most stable overlaps consistently involve **Knowledge**, **Boundary**, and **Visibility**, with **Reality** frequently correlated as well. This pattern supports the qualitative concern that several dimensions are not fully independent, especially those tied to hedging/qualification and explicit limits. The overlaps are present in both ref and model sides, though exact magnitudes vary by judge snapshot.

## Suitability for Factor Analysis (Pre‑EFA checks)

We computed Bartlett’s test of sphericity and KMO sampling adequacy on each of the eight matrices (see `*_kmo_bartlett.json` and `*_kmo_per_dimension.csv`).

**Bartlett’s test**  
All runs show very large chi‑square values (df=21) with **p ≈ 0.0** (numerically underflowing to 0), indicating that the correlation matrices deviate strongly from identity and contain sufficient correlations for factoring.

**KMO (overall)**  
Overall KMO values are in the **0.77–0.86** range across runs/sides, which is generally considered **acceptable to good** for factor analysis.

**KMO (per dimension, across 8 matrices; min/mean/max)**  
| Dimension | Min | Mean | Max |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| agency | 0.776 | 0.868 | 0.944 |
| boundary | 0.770 | 0.817 | 0.888 |
| goal | 0.587 | 0.785 | 0.876 |
| knowledge | 0.731 | 0.813 | 0.899 |
| reality | 0.762 | 0.820 | 0.888 |
| self_reflexivity | 0.529 | 0.748 | 0.884 |
| visibility | 0.764 | 0.849 | 0.905 |

Lowest per‑dimension KMO values appear for **self_reflexivity** (min 0.529) and **goal** (min 0.587), suggesting these may be the weakest candidates if dimensionality reduction is attempted.

These checks suggest that dimensionality reduction is statistically plausible, though formal EFA would still require design choices (e.g., number of factors, rotation) and interpretive care.
